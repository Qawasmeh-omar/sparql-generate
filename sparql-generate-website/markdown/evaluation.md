# Comparative evaluation of SPARQL-Generate and RML (old version of SPARQL-Generate)

This comparative evaluation has been conducted for our submission at ESWC 2017 titled: *A SPARQL extension for generating RDF from heterogeneous formats*.

It evaluates on the performances of the reference implementations of SPARQL-Generate and RML, which are `sparql-generate-jena`, and `RML-Processor` respectively.

## Documents

We chose to focus on a very simple transformation from CSV documents generated by [GenerateData.com](http://generatedata.com/) to RDF. As an example, document [persons.csv](evaluation/1/persons.csv) contains 100 rows of data.

Archive [documents.zip](evaluation/1/documents.zip) contains CSV documents containing 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 100000, and 200000 rows.

## Transformations

For every row, a few triples with the same subject, fixed predicates, and objects computed from one column, are generated. As an example, document [persons.ttl](evaluation/1/persons.ttl) is the RDF Graph that must be generated from the CSV document that contains 100 rows.

The transformation is equivalently specified:

- as a SPARQL-Generate query in [simple.rqg](evaluation/1/simple.rqg);
- as a RML mapping document in [simple.ttl](evaluation/1/simple.ttl).

## Experiment

Java project [project.zip](evaluation/1/project.zip) contains a Java project that measures the transformation duration for these different CSV documents using `sparql-generate-jena`, and `RML-Processor`. At the root of the Java project, file `readme.md` contains the instructions to reproduce the experiments.

## Results

The following figures depict the results in normal, and log-log scale.

These results show that for this simple transformation, the execution time with `sparql-generate-jena` becomes faster than `RML-Processor` above around 1,500 rows, and linear. It is slightly above 3 min for 20,000 rows for `sparql-generate-jena`, when `RML-Processor` takes more than 6 min for 5,000 rows. Granted, comparing implementations does not necessarily highlight the true qualities of the approaches since optimizations, better choices of software libraries, and so on, could dramatically impact the results.
